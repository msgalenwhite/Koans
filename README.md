### Koans

["[O]riginally a Koan in Zen-practice [was] a paradoxical question that provokes doubt and tests a student’s progress. On the other hand, programming Koans are a set of failing unit-tests, for which the learner is required to fix the code or fill the required fields with proper values in order to make each test pass. Probably one of the earliest and most popular Koans were Ruby Koans. Now there are several Koans implemented for different languages and frameworks. Search the word “Koan” in GitHub or BitBucket and you will find the gems."](https://sinairv.wordpress.com/2012/05/27/programming-koans-one-of-the-best-ways-to-learn-a-new-language-or-framework/)

This is a repository to store my Koan practices, so that I can have them (and the notes I take along the way) saved and easily accessible in the future.  Koans are an interesting way to cement knowledge in a language you have already learned the basics to, and raises questions that inspire you to continue learning.

### Ruby

To run the Ruby Koans, first cd into '/Ruby/koans'.  Then, run:

- ruby path_to_enlightenment.rb

This will run the test suite.
I got the Ruby koan files from Launch Academy.
